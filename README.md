# Ion

Extended, vanilla compatible Northstar fork (that means you can play on Northstar and Vanilla if you're wondering, revolutionary)

## Extras
* Sort of EMM inspired menu
* Some rudamentary Demo playback UI
* Loading progress
* Some less crashes in places maybe
* Vanilla compat whilst maintaining security hooks
* Spruced up UI because it is very ugly (not done yet)

## Why
They won't merge my Vanilla compatability PR :(

If you're a Vanilla+ user, this is also an upgrade since this fixes match settings, pretty baller

## Build
You'll want to use the branch repositories, build steps should be basically the same as normal Northstar:
* [Mods](https://github.com/VITALISED/NorthstarMods/tree/ion)
* [Launcher](https://github.com/VITALISED/NorthstarLauncher/tree/ion)
